# Project Plan: Main Branch Rebase and Condensation

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the process to rebase the main branch into a single consolidated commit and prepare it for remote replacement to trigger a patch deploy of the npm package.

## Comprehensive Requirements Analysis
- Condense all existing commits on main into a single commit
- Ensure the commit message includes "fix" to trigger a patch deployment
- Preserve the essential changes from existing commits
- Perform the operation locally without pushing to remote until explicitly requested
- Maintain the integrity of the codebase

## Step-by-step Implementation Plan
- [ ] Analyze current state of the repository
  - [ ] Examine commit history on main branch
  - [ ] Document important commit messages for preservation
- [ ] Prepare for rebasing
  - [ ] Create a backup branch of current main
  - [ ] Verify the working directory is clean
- [ ] Perform the rebase operation
  - [ ] Execute the rebase to squash all commits
  - [ ] Create a consolidated commit message with "fix" prefix
  - [ ] Verify the rebase was successful
- [ ] Validate the rebased code
  - [ ] Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
  - [ ] Run lint checks to ensure code quality
  - [ ] Verify build process succeeds
- [ ] Document the final state
  - [ ] Record the new commit hash
  - [ ] Document the process for pushing to remote

## Files to Modify
- No files will be directly modified, only git history will change

## Testing Strategy
- Run `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass after rebasing
- Run `pnpm lint` to ensure code quality is maintained
- Run `pnpm build` to verify the build process succeeds

## Risk Assessment
- **Loss of history**: Condensing commits loses detailed history (mitigated by backup branch)
- **Build failures**: Changes in commit structure might affect build process
- **Package versioning**: Ensure semantic versioning is properly triggered by commit message

## Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] All tests pass after rebase
- [ ] Lint checks pass after rebase
- [ ] Build process succeeds after rebase
- [ ] Git history shows a single commit with appropriate message

## Git Execution Strategy
- Branch name: Not applicable (working directly on main)
- Backup branch: `backup/main-pre-rebase-2025-04-02`
- Commit structure: Single commit with "fix" prefix

## Session Log

## Quick Context Restoration
- **Current branch**: main
- **Modified files**: None yet
- **Current state**: Planning phase

## Decision Points
None at this stage.
