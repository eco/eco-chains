fix: consolidate initial implementation of eco-chains

- Add chain definitions for Arbitrum, Base, Eco, Ethereum, Helix, Mantle, Optimism, and Polygon
- Implement TypeScript interfaces with typia for runtime type checking
- Add custom WebSocket tag validator
- Set up build and publish pipeline with semantic-release
- Configure linting and formatting
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Support API key replacement in RPC URLs

This consolidates the initial development of the eco-chains package.
